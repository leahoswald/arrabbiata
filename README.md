# Arabiata hugo theme

This theme is brought to you without big documentation, guaranties and support (for now). It is only a version of the theme used at https://leah.is, my private blog.

You have to put your posts in a folder called posts under the content folder of your site project.

Static sites are possible with the `menu = "main"` option in your markdown file header and directly under the content folder.

Images in a post header are possible with `image: /assets/images/new_page.jpg` in the same header.
